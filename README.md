# Battleships

## Introduction

Welcome to Battleships, a classic game implemented using Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. In this project, I built the famous Battleship game from scratch. You can play against the computer or locally against a friend.

As this project emphasises TDD, each functionality was implemented and tested independently to ensure the codeâ€™s reliability and maintainability.

## Additional features

**Intelligent computer Guessing**

The computer has been designed to guess locally on a successful hit, so do not give it too many chances!

**Win tracker**

Play multiple games to see who is the true champion with the play again feature!

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Node package manager, which is installed with Node.js
- **webpack**: Module bundler

## Usage
To run the development server with live reloading, use:

```bash
npm webpack serve --open
```

This will open the project in the default web browser and reload it on changes.

## Build for Production
To build the project for production, use:

```bash
npm webpack --mode production
```

This will create an optimised and minified version of the project in the dist directory.

To configure the project, edit the webpack.config.js file.
