# Battleships

## Introduction

Welcome to Battleships, a classic game implemented using Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. In this project, I built the famous Battleship game from scratch. You can play against the computer or locally against a friend.

As this project emphasises TDD, each functionality was implemented and tested independently to ensure the codeâ€™s reliability and maintainability.

To install webpack globally (optional):

```bash
npm install -g webpack webpack-cli

## Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git

cd your-project
Install dependencies:
npm install

## Usage
To run the development server with live reloading, use:

npx webpack serve --open
This will open your project in the default web browser and reload it on changes.

## Build for Production
To build the project for production, use:

npx webpack --mode production
This will create an optimized and minified version of your project in the dist directory.

To configure the project, edit the webpack.config.js file.
